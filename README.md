# MyWayToWebDev

I'm guiding myself through the courses available at frontendmasters.com (and I love it!).

The first course I've completed was: Complete Intro to Web Development, v2 by Brian Holt. Followed by Getting Started with JavaScript by Kyle Simpson, CSS Grids and Flexbox for Responsive Web Design by Jen Kramer, JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS by Bianca Galdolfo (which I haven't completed, only half of it) and now (april 2020) I'm diving deeper into JS fundamentals in the course JavaScript: The Hard Parts by Will Sentance, which is really awesome. Will goes absolutely clear to the point. I'll be uploading all the solutions I've coded for the training exercices he suggests the end of each subject.
